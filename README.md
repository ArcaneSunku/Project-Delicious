## ✨ Overview

**Project Delicious** is an early-stage **Adventure RPG** that blends traditional fantasy exploration with a grounded, player-influenced economy. Inspired by the cozy-yet-adventurous tone of *Campfire Cooking in Another World with My Absurd Skill*, the game places equal importance on **combat**, **craft**, and **commerce**.

Players are not just heroes — they are **participants in a living world**.

---

## 🧭 Core Concept

At the heart of the game is a **Dual Job System**:

### 🧑‍🌾 Main Job (Lifestyle Role)
This defines *how you exist* in the world.

- **Adventurer** – Dungeon delving, monster hunting, contracts, and combat-focused progression.
- **Merchant** – Trading, logistics, supply chains, market manipulation, and economic influence.

Your main job affects:
- NPC interactions
- Quest availability
- Income sources
- How the world responds to you

---

### ⚔️ Specialized Job (Combat / Skill Role)
This defines *how you solve problems*.

Examples include:
- Warrior
- Cleric
- Summoner
- Mage
- (More planned)

Specialized jobs determine:
- Combat abilities
- Skill trees
- Party synergies
- Playstyle expression

> You are never locked into being *just* a fighter or *just* a trader — the system is designed to encourage experimentation and identity.

## 🎮 Gameplay Pillars

- **Exploration-first design**
- **Player-driven economy**
- **Meaningful progression** without endless grind
- **Low-stakes coziness paired with high-stakes danger**
- **Systemic interactions** over scripted solutions

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

The project is intentionally lightweight and low-level to maintain control and performance.

- **Language:** C++
- **Rendering / Windowing:** [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)
- **Build System:** Premake

The goal is a clean, understandable codebase that favors **clarity and iteration** over premature abstraction.

## 🚧 Development Status

⚠️ **Very Early Development**

Current focus:
- Engine scaffolding
- Project structure
- Core gameplay architecture

Expect:
- Rapid iteration
- Breaking changes
- Systems evolving or being replaced entirely

This project is being built with **long-term vision**, not short-term polish.

## 🗺️ Planned Features (High-Level)

- Dual job progression system
- Dynamic NPC markets and pricing
- Crafting and cooking systems
- Party-based combat
- World simulation influenced by player actions
- Mod-friendly architecture (long-term goal)
